Most of the work so far has been done in C# with the twitter OAuth API. In order to easily link into the OAuth Twitter API I am using an Open Source Twitter plugin made for TwitPic that I adapted for our use. 

The consumer_key and consumer_secret have to be set in order to tweet. Once everything is a bit more final I will place mine in for everyone to use.
